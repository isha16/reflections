When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i want to share my work or when working with some one else.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might make changes you're not ready to push to your remote repository yet,
or you might be working on something someone else is working on at the same
time.
