When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i want to share my work or when working with some one else.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might make changes you're not ready to push to your remote repository yet,
or you might be working on something someone else is working on at the same
time.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
you make a branch in a local repository
you can clone something from github to your local computer
also you can clone a repository at a different place in the same local computer
forks let you clone a repository on github to your own repository on github.
