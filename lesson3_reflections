When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i want to share my work or when working with some one else.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might make changes you're not ready to push to your remote repository yet,
or you might be working on something someone else is working on at the same
time.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
you make a branch in a local repository
you can clone something from github to your local computer
also you can clone a repository at a different place in the same local computer
forks let you clone a repository on github to your own repository on github.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
when you have other collaborators for a project, you might wanna have their additions to the code in your local repository.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
making phone calls,video call or meeting in person but this may be problematic if collaborators are living far from you.
even if any of the above is successful it may be difficult to merge changes done by others to your own code for a very large project.
